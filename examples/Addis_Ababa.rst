The `evpv_examples <https://github.com/evpv-simulator/evpv-examples>`_ repository provides a collection of ready-to-use case studies, complete with all necessary input and configuration files. These examples can help you explore the capabilities of the EV-PV simulator and serve as blueprints for developing your own custom analyses. Each example includes all the required files to run it. When applicable, examples are provided with both a configuration file for execution in **basic mode** (using the command-line interface), and a Python run script for execution in **advanced mode** for more control.

The following examples are available:

- **AddisAbaba_Simple**: A simple yet complete case study on the city of Addis Ababa, showcasing the full set of core outputs (mobility demand, charging demand, and EV-PV complementarity). Both a configuration file and a Python run script are provided.
